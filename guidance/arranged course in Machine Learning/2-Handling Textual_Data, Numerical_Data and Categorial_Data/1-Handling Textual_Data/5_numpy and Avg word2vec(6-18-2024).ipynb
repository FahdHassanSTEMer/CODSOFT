    "### NumPy Library: An In-Depth Definition and Its Uses\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Definition:\r\n",
    "NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is an open-source library in Python that provides comprehensive support for numerical computing. It is widely recognized for its powerful N-dimensional array object, ndarray, which is essential for performing a wide range of mathematical and scientific computations efficiently. NumPy serves as the foundation for many other scientific computing libraries in Python, such as SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Core Features:\r\n",
    "1. **N-dimensional array object (ndarray):** The central feature of NumPy is the ndarray, a multidimensional container of items of the same type. The number of dimensions is defined by the array's shape, and the type of items is defined by the array's dtype.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting:** This feature allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes. NumPy can automatically expand the smaller array along the dimensions with size one to match the shape of the larger array.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Universal Functions (ufuncs):** These are functions that operate element-wise on arrays. NumPy provides a rich set of mathematical functions that can be applied to arrays, including trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic operations.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Linear Algebra Functions:** NumPy includes a variety of functions for performing linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, decomposition, eigenvalue computations, and more.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Random Sampling:** The library provides a suite of functions to generate random numbers, which are essential for simulations, statistical sampling, and data analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Integration with C/C++ and Fortran:** NumPy is designed to integrate seamlessly with code written in C/C++ and Fortran, allowing for efficient execution of performance-critical code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Detailed Uses:\r\n",

    "Certainly! Let's dive deeper into each code snippet from the lesson on fundamental NumPy functions and explain them in detail.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. Creating NumPy Arrays:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`np.array()`**: This function creates a NumPy array from a Python list or tuple. The array can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or higher-dimensional.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  import numpy as np\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "  a = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # 1D array\r\n",
    "  b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # 2D array\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`np.zeros()` and `np.ones()`**: These functions create arrays filled with zeros or ones, respectively. You specify the shape of the array as a tuple (rows, columns).\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  zeros_array = np.zeros((2, 3))  # 2x3 array of zeros\r\n",
    "  ones_array = np.ones((3, 2))    # 3x2 array of ones\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`np.arange()`**: This function generates an array with values within a specified range (start, stop, step).\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  range_array = np.arange(1, 10, 2)  # array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`np.linspace()`**: This function creates an array with evenly spaced values over a specified interval.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  linspace_array = np.linspace(0, 10, 5)  # array([ 0.,  2.5,  5.,  7.5, 10.])\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. Array Attributes:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Shape and Dimensions**: The `shape` attribute tells you the dimensions of the array (rows, columns, etc.), and `ndim` gives the number of dimensions.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  shape = a.shape  # (3,) for a 1D array\r\n",
    "  ndim = a.ndim    # 1 for a 1D array\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Size**: The `size` attribute provides the total number of elements in the array.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  size = a.size  # 3 for a 1D array with 3 elements\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Data Type**: The `dtype` attribute indicates the data type of the array's elements.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  dtype = a.dtype  # int64 if elements are integers\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3. Array Indexing and Slicing:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Indexing**: You can access individual elements of the array using indices. Remember that Python uses 0-based indexing.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",

    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Slicing**: Slice notation allows you to extract portions of an array. The format is `start:stop:step`.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  slice_array = a[1:3]      # Slice from index 1 to 2 (end index is exclusive)\r\n",
    "  slice_array2 = b[:, 1]    # Slice all rows, but only column 1\r\n",

    "  exponent = np.exp(a)      # Element-wise exponential\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Aggregation Functions**: NumPy offers functions to compute statistics across array elements.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  mean_value = np.mean(a)   # Compute mean of array\r\n",
    "  max_value = np.max(b)     # Find maximum value in array\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5. Reshaping and Concatenation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Reshaping**: The `reshape()` method changes the shape of an array without altering its data.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  reshaped_array = a.reshape((1, 3))  # Reshape to a 1x3 array\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",

    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 6. Random Number Generation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Random Numbers**: NumPy's `np.random.rand()` generates random numbers or arrays.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  random_number = np.random.rand()     # Generate a random number between 0 and 1\r\n",
    "  random_array = np.random.rand(2, 3)  # Generate a 2x3 array of random numbers\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Seed**: You can set the random seed using `np.random.seed()` for reproducibility of random numbers.\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  np.random.seed(0)  # Set random seed to 0\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
